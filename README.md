## Completed Features

### A Shattered Nation

The USA is longer a country instead it is a power block lead by Greater Washington with the rest of the US states as subjects.
Greater Washington is a union of six east coast states and is the leading and is the dominant voice in the federal US. It can call congress which can if enough sates vote for it enforce some of its own laws on the sates of the US, but this can trigger a civil war amongst the states in the union if the vote barely passes. 

Greater New York is a union of 3 east coast states and is the largest liberal anti-slavery block in the US.

Louisiana having abolished slavery following its abolition in France can move to reunite Frances old colony of New France.

Missouri recently had a popular royal coup which placed the enlighten Alexander Von-Blade on the newly created throne with the aim to feed all slaves. While Missouri might be a principality it forced to remain a sate by threat of invasion by the neighbouring states. On the back of Von-Reforms it can form the Missouri Native Commonwealth accepting the natives as equals.

### The Opportunistic Threat

Mexico has the opportunity to gain the anti-slave states of Missouri and Louisiana as subjects by assisting them to leave the pro-slavery US.

### The Spoils of Victory

The United Kingdom gained the colony of New England as well as creating a buffer state, the North Indian Federation which became a protectorate after US threats of reconquest. Any overload of nations in the former united states can form Columbia in the north and Cabotia in the south. The overload can also unite Columbia, Cabotia and Canada or any combination of them into a single nation with a dynamic name and flag based on if the nation has states in the north, south of the former US and Canada.

### A Threat from Europe

While Spanish authority in the new world was destroyed by Bonaparteâ€™s occupation of the mainland, Spain as successfully launched an expedition which reclaimed Cayo Hueso an island just off the cost of Florida which is a perfect springboard to launch a full recolonization of Florida a territory Greater Washington is also moving to secure.

Adding content for a second war of independence

### Adding content to form a united native America

That could be formed by the North Indian Federation by it becoming the dominant subject in north America and absorbing its neighbouring fellow subjects or breaking free and uniting north America by war. Perhaps even extending the nation to south America as well.

Or it could be formed by the Missouri native commonwealth with the ability to absorb decentralised nations in the new world. The nation formed by the Missouri native commonwealth would be a union between native Americans and European descended people

### Adding content that allows Europe to decide the fate of the new world

Nations in new world except for Greater Washington and maybe Brazil start as unrecognised powers.

A conference via a JE that allows for great powers to vote on resolution over the new world like the treaty of London JE with options for.

Reconquest by Spanish and Portuguese of their former colonies.

Recognition of independence (with a second JE to vote if they must become monarchies).

A new division by European powers.

No change.
